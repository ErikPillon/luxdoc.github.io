## How To
- **add/remove a team member**: If you want to modify the team members, just follow the blueprint in the ‵teams.yml‵ page; please notice that the size of the images needs to be squared and with a predefined size. You can use any tool you choose to crop and resize your image.
- **Add an event**: Adding an event to the list of events is easy, albeit a bit cumbersome the first time. You can inspire yourself by looking at the list of previous events and reproducing the structure of the event. Please notice that the event cover needs to be a specific size in order to be displayed properly.
